# Mart Management System School Project - Instructions

Welcome to the Mart Management System project! This project is designed to streamline the essential operations of a mart or store, such as managing products, inventory, sales, and customer data. Developed using Microsoft Access, it incorporates powerful features of Visual Basic (VB) and Macros to provide an interactive and functional database management system.

The goal of this project is not only to facilitate store operations but also to serve as a learning platform for enhancing your database design, coding, and system analysis skills. While the system is currently functional, there is significant room for improvement, customization, and feature expansion. Your contributions can help refine its design, improve user experience, and add valuable functionalities.

This system adheres to database design principles, emphasizing normalization to ensure data consistency and integrity. From designing tables and relationships to manipulating forms and queries, this project provides a comprehensive experience in building a robust database application.

Whether you’re looking to improve your understanding of database concepts or simply want to contribute to a practical and impactful project, the Mart Management System offers the perfect opportunity to apply and enhance your skills. Let’s collaborate to make it even better! <br/>

## **!!NOTE!!!System Design is Below**

## Principles to Focus on:

- **Normalization Principles (1NF, 2NF, 3NF):** Ensure that the database design follows normalization principles to eliminate redundancy and maintain data integrity. Review the tables and make necessary adjustments to achieve higher normalization levels.

- **Database Designing Principle:** Pay attention to the overall design of the database. Review the tables' structure and relationships to ensure they accurately represent the real-world entities and their associations.

## Areas of Focus:

- **Form Manipulation:** Review and improve the existing forms used in the system. Ensure they are user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and provide a smooth user experience. Feel free to modify the layout, add validation, or enhance functionalities as needed.

- **Table Manipulation:** Examine the tables used in the system. Check the data types and ensure consistency and accuracy in the data stored. If required, modify the table structures to better align with the needs of the mart management system.

- **Query Manipulation:** Inspect the existing queries and enhance them to provide useful information and insights for the mart management. You can create new queries to generate reports, track sales, or analyze inventory.

- **Relationship Manipulation:** Examine the relationships between tables and ensure they accurately represent the associations between various entities. Modify or establish new relationships where needed.

## Instructions for Improving the System:

- **Review Code and Logic:** Examine the VB and Macro elements used in the system. Ensure the code is well-organized, easy to understand, and follows best practices. Make necessary modifications to improve functionality and efficiency.

- **Add Missing Features:** Identify any crucial features that might be missing in the system and work on incorporating them. Examples could be sales reports, customer management, or notifications for low inventory.

- **Testing and Debugging:** Thoroughly test the system to identify and fix any bugs or errors. Verify that the data is correctly entered, stored, and retrieved from the database.

- **User Interface Enhancement:** Focus on the user interface and design a visually appealing and intuitive interface. Ensure that users can easily navigate the system and perform tasks efficiently.

- **Documentation:** Document the changes you make, the improvements you introduce, and any new features you add. This documentation will be valuable for future users and developers.

**Note:** As you work on the project, always double-check data types and filenames for tables with relationships to maintain data consistency and avoid errors.
